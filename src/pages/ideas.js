In the coming months, we will convene a series of public roundtable discussions where policy experts, stakeholders, and government officials will analyze pressing geopolitical challenges and work to reach consensus on actionable solutions. In [month], we will launch our inaugural ideas competition to solicit policy proposals for our first round of targeted acceleration.`,
